## 1.  Asymmetric Cryptography
Asymmetric cryptography uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
1. Public key:  used to encrypt  data.
2. Private key:  used to decrypt  data.

### 1.1 Asymmetric Algorithems
1. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman): <br>
Widely used for secure data transmission.

2. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): <br> 
Faster and more secure than RSA. 

### 1.2 The Secure Feature of Data:
  1. Enhanced Security
  2. Key Exchange
  3. Digital Signatures
  4. Scalability
  5. Secure Data Transmission


## 2.  Symmetric Cryptography
Symmetric cryptography uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.

### 2.1. Streaming keys
1. Stream key:   used to encrypt  data.
2. Block key:     used to decrypt  data.
