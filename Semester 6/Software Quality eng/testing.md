# Two main Limitations

1. Controllable
2. Observeability

# Fault Model
A hypothetical model of what type of foult  might occur in the implementation. 

1. Test suit development
2. Formolization of test purpose
3. For existing test suit
4. Coverage 
5. Diognostic

## Fault model for finite

## Activity
